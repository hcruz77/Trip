## Description
Often times we find ourselves endlessly scrolling through Instagram, devoid of any enriching or fulfilling content. Trip aims to utilize your interests to find websites, articles, and videos that you may find interesting.

## Instructions
Signup using the sign up form on the page. Once you are logged in fill out the mini questionaire. The program will take you to a random web article based on your interest from the questionaire.
